          <h2 class="post-title">Apple's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">1984</a>&nbsp;Commerical</h2>
          <p class="post-content">Why did Apple make this commerical? They wanted to go against the grain with the new release of the Mac. This video was supposed to show how the war in the computer industry is a few against many. I find this ironic today in the year of 2023 as Apple has become a monoploy of sortts in the Tech industry.</p>

          <h2 class="post-title">Failing with friends</h2>
          <p class="post-content">You learn from your failures. Let’s say you fail 20 times in a year. <br>

            If you have five friends that are also working on the same type of things. They may fail around 20 times too. <br>
            
            If you’re sharing those failures with each other. You failed 100 times in that year. <br>
            
            By sharing each others failures, you lived 5 years of failures in one year. Exponentially increasing your chances to succeed.</p>
